                <p>
                    Welcome! <br> Hi, I'm Felix Otieno, a passionate web developer, entrepreneur, and avid problem
                    solver based in Nairobi, Kenya. My journey began with a deep curiosity about how websites are
                    created, managed, and designed. This curiosity transformed into a career in technology, where I now
                    use my skills to build solutions that impact lives and empower businesses.
